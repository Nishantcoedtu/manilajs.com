## Let's try something different.
Instead of having speaking presentations, we'll have an open discussion to share how JavaScript has shaped our web development work. I'll be picking the brains of seasoned professionals on some relevant topics, such as:

* __ES6__: Have you adopted it? Why or why not? Has it helped?
* __Grunt/Gulp__: How has modern frontend development tools shaped your workflow?
* __io.js__: How is the future of Node.js going to be?
* __Anything else__: feel free to suggest topics!

### Still open for speakers!
The floor is open to anyone who has something interesting to share.
[Here are some details.](p/submitting-a-talk.html).

Manila.js Fridays happens (usually) every first Friday of the month.
Everybody's welcome!  Expect learning, fun, and happy conversations from people
just like you.  This event is free. Bring your friends!
